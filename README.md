# Traffic-Congestion-Analysis
---
This project's objective is to analyze patterns in traffic congestion, and based on this pattern, create a model that would be able to reliably identify said traffic congestion. Also, in this project, I would attempt to create a clustering model in order to group traffic condition patterns.

The data can be found on this link: **https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jHkNqPwGuhY0GNQERkPs0BZcxKDHQIP1/view?usp=sharing**

note: in order to make it easier to extract, it is decided that the data would be placed inside github
